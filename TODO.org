#+TITLE: TODO

* TODO Features
** TODO "Surprise me" command where members of a server can add a list of favorite subreddits and then a command picks a random post from each one
maybe only the server owner should be able to add subreddits to the favorites list....
** TODO need commands to:
*** TODO add subreddit to list
**** TODO /surprise add: ${subreddit}
*** TODO remove subreddit from list
**** TODO /surprise remove: ${subreddit}
*** TODO show current list
**** TODO /surprise show
*** TODO actually request a post:
**** DONE <prefix> <subreddit>
**** DONE <prefix> <subreddit> <type>
**** DONE <prefix> <subreddit> <type> <time>
**** DONE <prefix> <subreddit> <type> <time> <amount>
**** TODO /surprise
send a single surprise
**** TODO /surprise <amount>
request n surprises (up to server limit)
* TODO limit content types
** TODO resources > channel > get channel
channel object has nsfw field; get channel using the ID from the request. two cases:
    if the channel is nsfw, allow all subreddits
    if the channel is not nsfw, only allow to pull from some preapproved list of subreddits
        here, reddit's top 100 may be a good choice. goota look into it
* TODO Interfaces
** TODO reddit
*** DONE want to wrap creddit commands
*** TODO what happens when a subreddit doesn't exist?
** TODO discord
* TODO misc
** DONE at least some pinned posts are marked as not being pinned by the API
turns out the API just returns n+1 posts if one is pinned -- tricky!
* TODO server-owner configuration
** TODO maximum number of requestable posts
*** DONE read from an edn
*** DONE write to an edn
*** TODO interaction that does this
*** TODO needs to check that we don't exceed global embed limit or reddit API limit
though I guess if we exceed the embed limit, can't we just send another embed
(or nine other embeds) in follow-up messages? looking at the docs it seems like
there isn't a restriction on the number of follow-up messages that can be sent,
so if someone requests, say, 100 posts, and all of them are embeds, then we send
the original response and nine follow up messages containing other embeds
(because embeds can only have ten things in them at a time.)
* TODO edit the embed url content
Eventually it's going to become too much of a pain to compute how many posts we
were able to embed vs send raw etc. Once follow-up messages are ready, only say
how many posts we had to skip!
* DONE refactor utils in commands.clj
** DONE move get-value, contains-key?, and get-values-with-key to util.clj
*** DONE get-value
- m is a vec of maps like =[{"name" "subreddit", "value" "cats"} {"name" "section", "value" "top"}]=
*** DONE contains-key?
- m is a map like ={:embed "http://url.com"}=
*** DONE get-values-with-key
** DONE rename to be more accurate
** DONE add doc strings
* TODO config file needs to be indexed by guild IDs
* DONE command responses need to be in embeds
* DONE we have a max of 10 things per embed so gotta update the limit in get-posts
* DONE security
** DONE figure out good way to have credentials in
